# Uncertainty

### June 20th, 2020

We wake up in the morning, get ready to go out, and open up our phones to check the weather before going out. What will be the weather be like? Will it be warm and sunny, or cold and rainy? We look up weather forecasts in hopes to avoid the unexpected and to be prepared.

Humans are addicted to certainty. Humans are wired for certainty due to evolution where if we were to risk death if not for certainty.

Certainty is order. Uncertainty is chaos.

Humans are predisposed to be risk-averse and to avoid risk. Yet, most rewards are intertwined with risks.

Modern risks are minute compared those of the past. The past risks were often associated with death. Coming near a wild animal meant death. Trying that new alluring fruits or berries often meant death.

These overshadow today's risks.

We, today, are exposed to risks minuscule in comparison. Refusing to listen to the orders of superiors will lead to unemployment. Going skydiving exposes you to small chance to complications. Killing others will lead to incarceration, not death.

Some would say that there are greater benefits associated with the rewards offsetting the risks.

We are taught to play safe. Play by the rules and system.

I am of the opinion that there is more to be gained from rewards and that we must strive for the fruits. This is not to say we should encompass all risks associated. Humans are creative animals. We must manifest ways to diminish the risks associated to increase the expected value.

Perhaps, we should model those behaviours of that of hermit crabs. Hermit grows from a small outer shell into those of larger shell in increments throughout their lifespan. Likewise, we must learn to endure smaller risks and grow into better and stronger shells. Beyond the end-goal, we mustn't be hurried into finding oversized shells that we cannot harness. Otherwise, we will be crushed by the shell instead.

Ordo Ab Chao. We all dream of the end with little knowns about the journey. The journey is made from uncertainty. Life with uncertainty strengthens us and is to be embraced.
