# Unmasking Emotions

## September 23rd, 2023

*This is a part of my series on becoming on adult. Part 3: Who am I looking for?*

Surprisingly, I've never written a romance piece, despite love and its related complexities dominating my life for the past two years. My few friends are probably exhausted from hearing about my tumultuous love life. For those unaware, I've been in an on-and-off long-distance relationship with my high school sweetheart for about eighteen months, starting in late 2021. While the relationship has been an incredible journey, it sadly came to an end, leaving me with these private reflections and a determination to move forward.

They were like rain, sunshine, and tornadoes in my lonely desert, revealing that life could thrive, and my arid existence could transform into a lush forest. They showed me that life is worth living, more than just a slow march toward inevitable solitude and emptiness.

Their smile made me smile. I wanted the world to witness the beauty of their mind. I discovered that life encompasses much more than the pursuit of "financial independence." They filled a void I had carried throughout my life. They showed me that I am, indeed, a social being, even though pseudoscientific MBTI tests labeled me as 97% Thinking and 3% Feeling. Strangely, with them, those percentages seemed to reverse. They allowed me to shed tears instead of masking my trauma with dark humor. My trust in them was absolute. I entrusted them with secrets that remained hidden from friends and family. I wish I could still confide in them.

Ironically, this isn't our first breakup. I believe it's the fourth, though I've honestly lost count. This time, it is different. We both recognize the need to move on, despite lingering emotions. Despite believing that our strong suit was communication, I'm not so sure anymore, especially considering the week-long miscommunication that led to our breakup.

I was ready for commitment from the start, while they carried the scars of a previous long-distance relationship, making them cautious. We were together yet not quite. Our relationship lacked a clear label. We experimented with various labels and arrangements, but none of it mattered to me as long as I could be with them. At some point, I questioned if they were "the One" and sought confirmation through a few dates. Regrettably, I failed to take those dates, or dating apps in general, seriously. When the time came to determine if they were right for me when they asked me to be introduced their parents, uncertainty prevailed. I could point fingers, but the truth is simpleâ€”-I should have done better. Hindsight is always 20/20. I wish I could turn back time and speak with certainty.

They were the motivation behind my best efforts, yet I allowed myself to be distracted by trivial matters, causing our relationship to suffer. In hindsight, I've made many positive changes, becoming more deliberate with my time and energy. However, I realize I should have implemented these changes earlier. I'm on the brink of returning to that lonely, desolate desert, though I know better. Nevertheless, the pain is too intense to power through. They may want me to vilify them, but I cannot. How can I demonize a ray of hopeful light that healed me and unveiled the beauty of life? It's ironic because they believe I deserve better for the world, yet they've become my world.

Rationally, I understand there are other potential partners, but emotionally, I can't seem to move forward and simply swipe right. As I contemplate the qualities I seek in someone else, I realize I may not be ready to embark on that journey just yet. I've been on interviews and post-interview dates, but it's not what I'm truly looking for. My criteria is challenging to fulfill on modern dating apps, which often prioritize external appearances and values. When asked about my ideal partner, my answer remains straightforward: "Someone I can trust and be vulnerable with." Some have laughed, claiming that's the foundation of every relationship. If it's that common, one might think it's a simple issue to resolve. However, I believe the problem lies within my own difficulty trusting others.

I like to believe I'm an honest person, an open book when it comes to topics like finance and politics. Yet, there's one aspect I struggle to share--my emotions. I may not experience a wide range of emotions, but when I do, I often find myself at a loss for how to handle them. While I've matured in many aspects of life, emotions remain an area where growth is needed. Perhaps it's less about finding the right person and more about working on myself.

I've been told that I'm approachable but difficult to maintain a connection with due to my perceived lack of passion. Recognizing these shortcomings, I've been making both external and internal changes. Although I worry that time won't heal everything, I know that change will come, hopefully for the better. I miss you greatly, C. I wish you the best, but it's time for our paths to diverge.
