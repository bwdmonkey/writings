# Growing Pains

## July 1st, 2024

*This is a part of my series on becoming on adult. Part 4: Who am I?*

> I feared that I'm alone in this world. You melted my cold world and calmed the fear away. You became the proof I'm not alone. You showed me true love and accepted me for who I am. I will eternally be grateful to have had you in my life. While it's certain that I will want to press my nose against the window of your life, I don't want to go back inside. I will watch from far and wish you tranquility and eudaimonia. [...]

It's over. This rollercoaster of a relationship has come to a full halt.[^1] I wanted to hold on yet knew that I had let go. It was necessary for me to cut all communications including them and their mutuals to avoid the cycle. On the one hand, I felt the confusion, denial and sadness, on the other, I felt some bitter relief. The future I envisioned with them were bleak and blurry. Plans of vacations, immigration to the States and back to Canada, meeting families were no more.

In the aftermath, I started reviving my old future goals, switching companies, starting my own business, and fixing my bad habits. Yet it wasn't the same, I had goals, but had no reasons for these goals. I was simply pursuing new goals to fill the void.

While I had some offers, I stopped myself. I hesitated. I realized a move solely for a change of scenery and financial gain would likely disrupt my work-life balance and compromise my values. It was time to reassess my life, to rediscover **who I am**.

I asked myself questions to better course-correct my life. The questions were:

- What feelings do I want to feel in the future?
- What will I most be proud of in 1/3/5/10 years from today?
- What would you tell yourself in the exact same situation?
- What would I do if I was fearless and could not fail?
- and more...

As I answered these questions, things became more clear. Few things I learned:

- I like building things.
- I like learning things.
- I like recognition for my work.
- I like non-physically helping other people.
- I prefer earning 10k on my own than 20k from work or gift.
- I do get lonely and will need a life partner at some point.
- My health is shit.

With these clarities, it was clear what I needed to do. I need to learn, build, and exercise. Here are some of the things I'm doing.

### Learn

- Biweekly book club
- Weekly entrepreneur club
- 14-month MBA micro-degree
- Backend topics as I switched to a different full-stack team

### Build

- Conducting interviews on non-profits to understand how I can help and scale that into a potential business
- Financial planning of the next 10 years
- Social circle that I trust

### Exercise

- Running 3x/week
- Correcting body posture
- Regulating my daily routine (sleep schedule, supplements, focus hours, etc)

Outside of these actions, my life continues its journey, whether I am fully aware or not. I gained Permanent Resident status in Canada. I also switched to a full-stack team, where I can explore more backend technology like I wanted. I had a honest and deeply meaningful conversation with my mom about how I felt growing up and how she felt raising me. I am hitting these big life milestones despite everything. I guess life gives and takes. I wish I could celebrate it with them, yet I shall celebrate by myself for now. I don't want to go back inside. I need to find my own tranquility and eudaimonia. Hopefully, I am on my way.
